# Resources
I primarily used the Canvas resources but these other Stack Overflow articles helped me troubleshoot some errors I was having.

1. [Stack Overflow 1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6257619/how-get-an-apostrophe-in-a-string-in-javascript)
This reminded me of how to use an apostrophe in my string correctly..

2. [Stack Overflow 2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2075337/uncaught-referenceerror-is-not-defined)
This helped me learn more about my reference error and that I added jQuery incorrectly. I needed to revisit my script tags.

# Deductions
